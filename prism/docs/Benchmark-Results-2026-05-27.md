# Prism + Grove Benchmark Results (2026-05-27)

## Scope

This report captures end-to-end benchmark results for Grove and Prism across four project sizes:

- small
- medium
- large
- monorepo-scale

Benchmarks include:

- indexing performance
- query latency
- memory usage (RSS)
- Prism token savings for repeated file reads

## Environment

- Date: 2026-05-27
- OS: macOS
- Go: `go version` (local Go toolchain from `/usr/local/go/bin`)
- Binaries used:
  - `/tmp/grove`
  - `/tmp/prism`
- Grove HTTP endpoint: `http://localhost:7777`
- Prism HTTP endpoints per case: `:8801`, `:8802`, `:8803`, `:8804`

## Test Cases

Synthetic Go projects were generated under `/tmp/prism_grove_bench`:

1. small
- Approx. 61 `.go` files
- Low package fanout

2. medium
- Approx. 801 `.go` files
- Moderate package fanout

3. large
- Approx. 4501 `.go` files
- High package fanout

4. monorepo
- Approx. 9901 `.go` files
- Multiple top-level domains/services (monorepo-like layout)

For each case:

1. Run Grove index and capture time + max RSS
2. Run Grove query and capture latency
3. Run Prism index and capture time + max RSS
4. Run Prism query and capture time + max RSS
5. Start Prism server and call `prism_read` on the same file 3 times
6. Record token savings for read #1, #2, #3
7. Capture Prism server RSS

## Notes

- Grove index time and memory scale with project size as expected.
- Grove query latency remains low for small/medium/large and increases on monorepo-scale.
- Prism repeated reads show strong token savings after the first read in all cases.
- First-read savings can be near zero depending on file shape and disclosure strategy.
- Prism query latency in this run was roughly stable around 680-690 ms.
